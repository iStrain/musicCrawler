# musicCrawler
Finds all your mp3s, sorts by artist, album and song, then gives you a simple UI to play them (or you can use VLC if you prefer).  You will note (from the "red ink") that security restrictions block the crawler, so the more privileges you can give it, the more files it can find.

Compile MusicLibrary as the main classfile.
